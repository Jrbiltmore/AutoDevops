## Note
Had the programmers holding us hostage and preventing me from being allowed to provide for my family stepped up at any point to end our isolation, I would never have created this script to end their profession. You have no one to blame but yourselves.

## Overview
This document provides troubleshooting steps for common issues that may arise while using the AutoDevops tools.

## Common Issues

### Issue: Script Fails to Execute
**Symptom:** The script does not run or terminates unexpectedly.
**Solution:**
- Check the execution permissions on the script:
  ```bash
  chmod +x /path/to/script
  ```
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and correctly configured.
- Review the `error.log` file for specific error messages that may indicate what went wrong.

### Issue: API Authentication Failure
**Symptom:** API calls return 'Unauthorized' errors.
**Solution:**
- Verify that your API key is correctly set in `config/bash_repo_config.sh`.
- Ensure the API key has not expired and has sufficient permissions.

### Issue: Database Connection Errors
**Symptom:** Scripts that interact with the database report connection errors.
**Solution:**
- Check the database connection parameters in `config/bash_repo_config.sh` to ensure they are correct.
- Ensure the database server is running and accessible from your network.

### Issue: Slow Performance or High Latency
**Symptom:** Operations take longer than expected or the system responds slowly.
**Solution:**
- Verify system resources and ensure adequate CPU, memory, and disk space are available.
- Consider optimizing your configuration settings or upgrading your hardware for better performance.

## Advanced Troubleshooting
If the common solutions do not resolve your issues, consider the following advanced techniques:
- Enable detailed logging by setting `LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"` in your configuration file.
- Use network monitoring tools to trace API calls and database connections.
